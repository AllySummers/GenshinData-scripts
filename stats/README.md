TODO

Reminder that the first input has to match file name exactly. It's 'hutao' not 'Hu Tao'.

```
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/theBowja/GenshinData-scripts@main/stats/dist/genshinStatsAll.js'></script>
<script>
console.log(GenshinStats.calcStatsForCharacter('hutao', 90));
</script>
```
